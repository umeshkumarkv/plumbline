#### Three stages: ORIGINATOR → BENCHMARK → JUDGE

Every attempt of this loop runs three stages, in this order. They are separate roles. This command is the **orchestrator**:
it fetches inputs into files, calls the originator, runs the benchmark, calls the judge, routes feedback, counts attempts,
escalates, and makes every external write (JIRA, GitHub, Confluence) only after both stages pass and a human approves.

| Stage | Who | What it decides | Sees |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Originator | the `plumbline-<role>-originator` subagent this orchestrator calls (Claude Code: `.claude/agents/`; Copilot: `.github/agents/`) | produces or revises the artifact | the brief, the input files, the rulebook, the feedback (attempt 2+) |
| 2. Benchmark | `bench/run.py` (deterministic, no LLM) | measurable facts: PASS / FAIL / WARN per check | the artifact + the repo / CI / supplied facts |
| 3. Judge | the isolated `plumbline-critic` | what code cannot measure: correctness, completeness, quality | the artifact, the benchmark report, the rubric, the rulebook. **Never** your reasoning or drafts |

**Every run starts at attempt 1.** The attempt counter lives only in this run, never in files. If `.plumbline/run/work/{name}/`
exists from an earlier run, move it to `.plumbline/run/work/{name}/previous-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>/` before Stage 1 (keep it as history;
do not read its attempt number). Existing drafts in `.plumbline/run/review/` are the starting artifact for attempt 1, and the
last run's open findings (from its escalation or feedback file) go into attempt 1's feedback file.

Rules
1. **Benchmark first.** Run Stage 2 as soon as the artifact is written. If its verdict is **FAIL**, this attempt
   fails: every FAIL check becomes a gap (`BENCH:<check id> — <detail>`), **skip Stage 3** and go to the Decision
   step. Fixing those needs no LLM opinion, and the judge's time is spent only on artifacts that are measurably sound.
2. **The judge gets the report as facts.** Pass `.plumbline/run/review/{name}-benchmark.md` to the critic as `BENCHMARK`.
   The judge does not re-check what the benchmark measured; it judges what it could not. WARN items are for the
   judge to weigh. Checks marked `supplied` depend on data you provided (e.g. JIRA): the judge may question them.
3. **Both must pass.** The loop passes only if the benchmark verdict is PASS **and** the judge verdict is PASS.
   The judge cannot override a benchmark FAIL; a benchmark PASS is not an approval.
4. **Never weaken the benchmark.** Do not edit `bench/`, its fixtures, the gates, the baseline or the rulebook to turn
   a check green. A wrong check is reported to the user as a benchmark defect, with the evidence.
5. **Exit code 2** (usage error: missing artifact or input) is your mistake, not a gap: fix the command and re-run.

#### Feedback loop — how a failed attempt is fixed (at least 3 attempts before a human)

```
attempt 1..3:  ORIGINATOR writes / revises ──► BENCHMARK ──PASS──► JUDGE ──PASS──► done (handoff)
                     ▲                             │ FAIL            │ FAIL
                     └──── failing checks ─────────┘                 │
                     └──── findings: rule · location · fix ──────────┘
after attempt 3 without PASS ──► ESCALATE to a human with the full history
```
1. **What goes back to the originator:** exactly the failing benchmark checks (`BENCH:<id>`, detail, evidence) and the
   judge's findings (`JUDGE:<id>`, rule, `path:line` + quote or what is missing, required fix). Never the critic's free
   text, and never a verdict to aim for.
2. **The originator fixes each item** in the artifact and writes `.plumbline/run/work/{name}/fixlog.md`, one line per item:
   `<id> — fixed: <what changed, where>` or `<id> — disputed: <evidence>`. A disputed item stays open. The originator
   may not delete or weaken a rubric item, test or check to close a finding.
3. **The next attempt re-runs both stages in full.** The benchmark re-runs every check, so a fix that breaks something
   else is caught. The judge runs again in a **new** context. It gets the revised artifact, the new benchmark report and
   `PRIOR_FINDINGS` (ids, rules, locations only) to mark each RESOLVED or STILL PRESENT. It never gets the fix log.
4. **At least 3 attempts.** `max_attempts = 3`. A loop escalates only when attempt 3 still fails, or at once on one of
   its Hard Stops (decisions only a human can make: missing design, blocked dependency, scope outside CLAUDE.md).
   If attempt 2 fails on the same items as attempt 1, attempt 3 must take a different approach and say which.
5. **The escalation report** lists, per attempt: the benchmark verdict and failing checks, the judge's findings, and what
   the originator changed. It then lists the items still open, disputed items with both sides' evidence, and the
   decision needed from the human. Nothing is written to JIRA, GitHub or Confluence as approved.

Exceptions: `/plumbline-devops` pushes its fix to the feature branch before Stage 2 because its evidence is a CI run
(never to `main`/`develop`, nothing merged). `/plumbline-code-review` has no originator: the PR under review is the
artifact, so it runs Stages 2 and 3 only.

Set `G=${PLUMBLINE_HOME:-.plumbline}` (absolute path when running inside a review worktree). The base branch is
`base_branch` in `$G/project.yaml` (written by `init.py`); where this spec says `develop`, use that branch.

**Repository layout.** This spec writes service paths as `services/{service}/` (the broker-dealer layout). The real
location of each unit comes from `python3 "$G/impact/layout.py" .` (name, path, kind): `services/<name>/`, a top-level
module, or an app at the repository root (path `.`, code in `./src/`, its CLAUDE.md is `src/CLAUDE.md`; the root CLAUDE.md is
the master file: solution and architecture). CLAUDE.md files are merged, never overwritten (`bench/claude_merge.py`). Read every
`services/{service}/` below as that unit's path, and `frontend/` as the frontend unit's path (e.g. `ui/`). The benchmark,
scope check and gates use the same layout. If the unit you need is not listed, STOP: a human declares it in
`.plumbline/project.yaml`.
