# /pl-qa

Test one story's acceptance criteria against the **running** system — API calls and, for UI criteria, Playwright — and
record the evidence. A **runner** subagent executes the tests; an independent **judge** checks the evidence actually
proves each criterion. Up to 3 attempts, then it is handed to the user. QA reports what it observed; it never fixes or
diagnoses code.

Story: $ARGUMENTS

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-qa-runner` or `plumbline-judge` — in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`): wait for each result before the next step.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with
  agent `plumbline-qa-runner` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`). If subagents are not available, stop and say so.

Never do the runner's or the judge's work yourself. **Shell:** run only `git` (and `gh` if present) yourself. Do not research the code yourself — that is the
writer's/runner's and the judge's job; you route, check scope and hand over.
If a helper replies with `FILE: <path>` and the content instead of writing the file, save that content to the path
unchanged, then continue.

## Drafts
Evidence goes in `.plumbline-drafts/<KEY>/qa/`. Make sure the line
`.plumbline-drafts/` is in `.git/info/exclude` — read and edit that file with your file tools (no shell `echo`/`mkdir`).

## Step 1 — Setup
1. Fetch the story and its acceptance criteria (JIRA tools, or ask the user to paste them). Save them as
   `.plumbline-drafts/<KEY>/story.md`.
2. **Gate:** the change should be reviewed first — the PR for this story has a passing `/pl-code-review` or a
   human approval. If not, tell the user and ask whether to continue.
3. URLs from the root `CLAUDE.md` Plumbline settings (API URL, frontend URL); ask if missing. The system must be
   running: ask the user to start it if the API URL does not answer.
4. Credentials come **only** from environment variables (`PLUMBLINE_DEMO_USER`, `PLUMBLINE_DEMO_PASSWORD`, or what the
   CLAUDE.md names). Never write a password or token into a file, a report or a comment.
5. Classify each criterion: **API** (status/body), **UI** (what the user sees), or **BOTH** (a submit flow); and
   **WRITES** (creates/changes data) or **READS**. Show the table and write it to `.plumbline-drafts/<KEY>/qa/plan.md`.

## Step 2 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Runner** — start `plumbline-qa-runner` with: the plan path, the story path, the URLs, the names of the credential
   environment variables, the evidence path `.plumbline-drafts/<KEY>/qa/evidence.md`; on attempts 2–3 the judge's
   findings.
2. **Judge** — start `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* the evidence path, the plan and story paths;
   *Checklist:* the **QA evidence checklist** below, verbatim.
3. PASS (every criterion passed, judge PASS) → Step 3. Judge FAIL (evidence does not prove the criteria) → next
   attempt. A criterion that genuinely **fails** is not retried away: it is the result — go to Step 3 with it.

### QA evidence checklist
1. Every criterion has a result (PASS / FAIL) with the exact request or UI steps, the expected and the actual outcome.
2. Each PASS is proven by checking the field and value the criterion names, not only the status code.
3. Writes: the evidence shows the data really changed (a follow-up read, or the database/event when the plan has
   access).
4. Standard edge cases were run where they apply: unknown id → 404, no credentials → 401/redirect, invalid input →
   400/422, response format as the CLAUDE.md files describe.
5. UI checks assert the behaviour the criterion describes, not just that an element exists.
6. Nothing was skipped without a stated infrastructure reason; no password or token appears in the evidence.
7. Failures are reported as observed (request, expected, actual, body) — no guesses at the cause.

## Step 3 — Hand over
Show: criterion · type · result. For each failure, exactly four fields: request/steps · expected · actual · response
body. If a failure looks like a design problem (wrong owner field, role, missing header), say "design gap — run
`/pl-arch <KEY>`" and nothing more. Ask before posting the report as a JIRA comment or moving the ticket — show
the exact text first and wait for a yes.
