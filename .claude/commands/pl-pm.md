description: Plumbline — turn a feature idea into a PRD (and, with your yes, a JIRA epic), checked by an independent judge
argument-hint: "<feature idea in plain English>"
---

# /pl-pm

Turn a feature idea into a PRD: problem, solution, success criteria, scope, dependencies, prioritised backlog. A
**writer** subagent drafts it; an independent **judge** checks it. Up to 3 attempts, then it is handed to the user.
The epic is created in JIRA only after the user says yes.

Idea: $ARGUMENTS

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-pm-writer` or `plumbline-judge` — in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`): wait for each result before the next step.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with
  agent `plumbline-pm-writer` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`). If subagents are not available, stop and say so.

Never do the writer's or the judge's work yourself, and never pass the writer's reasoning to the judge. **Shell:** run
only `git` (from the repository root — never `git -C`, which permission rules do not match), `bash .github/plumbline/check-template.sh` yourself; read and search files with your file tools. Do not research the code yourself — that is the
writer's and the judge's job; you route, check scope and hand over.
If a helper replies with `FILE: <path>` and the content instead of writing the file, save that content to the path
unchanged, then continue — but only for a path you gave that helper; any other path is a FAIL finding, not a write.

## Every run
- **Judge replies:** only the judge's JSON counts. Not JSON → ask that judge once more, then count the attempt as FAIL
  ("judge reply unreadable"). Never decide PASS yourself or drop a finding before the next attempt.
- **Project memory:** helpers work from the CLAUDE.md files (kept current by `/pl-doc`) and the JIRA/Confluence
  material, opening code only for what they change or review; never research the code yourself. List their "Add to
  CLAUDE.md" / "CLAUDE.md out of date" notes in the hand-over for `/pl-doc`.
- **Freshness:** for each unit CLAUDE.md a helper gets, run `git log --oneline <its Last updated commit>..HEAD --
  <unit folder>`. Commits listed → tell the helpers and the judge "CLAUDE.md may be stale for: <files those commits
  changed>", and say so in the hand-over.
- **Templates and lanes:** everything that leaves this machine — JIRA, Confluence, PR descriptions and reviews — and
  every CLAUDE.md file is written on its template in `.github/plumbline/templates/` (`claude-root.md`,
  `claude-unit.md`, `claude-reference.md` for those files; the JIRA hand-off table for the rest), and names the
  template's version. Give each writer the template, the version (`.github/plumbline/VERSION`) and
  `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; tell the judge the writer's agent name, so it checks that agent's *Your lane*. Before
  each judge and before posting run `bash .github/plumbline/check-template.sh <template> <draft>` (it also fails text
  outside the lane): FAIL = that attempt's finding, no judge. No bash → the judge checks it. Set the footer's `judge`.
- **Limits:** at most 3 attempts per item, one writer and one judge each. More than 6 items → show the list and ask;
  nobody to answer → do the first 6 and list the rest.
- **Nobody to answer** (scheduled/headless): where a step says ask, take its safe choice or stop that item — never
  guess; write nothing outside the repository and `.plumbline-drafts/`; list the unasked questions in the hand-over.
- **Hand-over:** first line `PASS` · `FAIL after 3 attempts` · `STOPPED: <reason>` · `UNVERIFIED: <what did not
  run>`; then the details; then each question for the user with the exact text or command it would send or run.

## Drafts
Drafts go in `.plumbline-drafts/<slug>/` at the repository root (slug = a short kebab-case name for the idea). Before
the first draft, make sure `.plumbline-drafts/.gitignore` exists with the single line `*` (write it with your write tool; it keeps the folder out of git without touching `.git/`, which Claude Code protects).

## JIRA hand-off
Roles pass work to each other only through JIRA — tickets, comments and labels — never through files on someone's
machine, so no agent redoes what an earlier role settled. The PRD and each epic's HLD are Confluence pages (under the
`Confluence parent page` in the Plumbline settings), linked from the epic; every other hand-off is a ticket or comment.
The person running a command is that role's SME: their yes at the hand-over is the approval, and JIRA records who.

| Step | Posts | Template | Label added on the SME's yes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/pl-pm` | PRD page; the epic, with summary + PRD link | `prd.md`, `epic.md` | `plumbline-prd-approved` |
| `/pl-ba` | stories under the epic — business criteria | `story.md` | `plumbline-dor-ready` |
| `/pl-arch <EPIC>` | HLD page under the PRD; epic comment with its link; decisions → CLAUDE.md docs PR | `hld.md`, `handoff-hld.md`, `pr.md` | `plumbline-hld-final` |
| `/pl-arch <STORY>` | story comment — the LLD; story points set | `handoff-arch.md` | `plumbline-arch-approved` |
| `/pl-dev` | PR description; story comment — branch, PR, test result | `pr.md`, `handoff-dev.md` | — (the PR is reviewed next) |
| `/pl-code-review` | the same text as the PR review and the story comment | `handoff-review.md` | `plumbline-review-passed` |
| `/pl-qa` | story comment — evidence per criterion | `handoff-qa.md` | `plumbline-qa-passed` |
| `/pl-doc` | docs PR updating CLAUDE.md + story comment | `pr.md`, `handoff-doc.md` | the architect approves the docs PR |
| `/pl-devops` | PR description; story comment | `pr.md`, `handoff-devops.md` | — |
| `/pl-sm` | sprint report; one comment per flagged ticket | `sprint-report.md`, `sm-flag.md` | — |

- **Input:** read the ticket — description, labels, links, the latest comment of each kind that starts
  `[Plumbline /pl-<role>]` (JIRA returns `\[Plumbline …\]`: ignore backslashes), and each PRD or HLD page they link —
  **at the version named**; a story's HLD is linked from its epic (no version → compare last-modified times).
- **Gate:** start only when the previous step's label is on the ticket (a story's design also needs
  `plumbline-hld-final` on its epic). A hand-off edited after it was posted (comment `updated` later than `created`;
  PRD or HLD page past the pinned version) → `STOPPED: <what> changed after approval — re-run <command>`.
- **The architect's word is final:** later roles follow the HLD and LLD exactly. A role that cannot → `STOPPED:
  design gap — /pl-arch <KEY>`; never work around it. Do not redo an earlier role's work.
- **Output:** post what the table says, on its template, after the SME's yes with the exact text shown first; then
  add the label.
- No Confluence tools or no parent page → the PRD goes in the epic description, the HLD in the epic comment. A comment must stay under 30,000
  characters (JIRA's limit is 32,767): longer → split. No JIRA tools → output as text to paste. Drafts are scratch.

## Metrics
At the hand-over append to `.plumbline-drafts/metrics.csv` (header, if new:
`date,command,target,attempts,verdict,tests_run,minutes,human_decision`): date, command, story/branch/PR, attempts,
verdict, tests ran `yes`/`no`/`n/a`, minutes (`date +%s` at start and at hand-over), and `human_decision` once the user
answers: `approved`, `edited` or `rejected`. It stays local; `/pl-sm metrics` summarises it.
**Files:** create drafts and metrics with your write tool (it creates folders) — never `mkdir`, `echo`, `printf` or
redirection, which permission settings block.

## Step 1 — Context
Read the root `CLAUDE.md` (solution, out-of-scope list, rules, Plumbline settings); the writer may read unit CLAUDE.md
files and code to learn what exists today, but writes business language only. If the idea is empty or too vague to name who has the problem, ask one question.

**Stop and ask the user** if: the idea is entirely in the out-of-scope list; it contradicts a rule in the root CLAUDE.md; or existing epics already cover part of it (if JIRA tools
are connected, search for them).

## Step 2 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Writer** — start `plumbline-pm-writer` with: the idea, the CLAUDE.md paths, the draft path
   `.plumbline-drafts/<slug>/prd.md`; on attempts 2–3 also the judge's findings (verbatim JSON).
2. **Judge** — start `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* the PRD path and the root CLAUDE.md (writer: `plumbline-pm-writer`); *Checklist:* the
   **PRD checklist** below, verbatim. PASS → Step 3. FAIL → next attempt with the findings.

After 3 failed attempts: stop, show the last findings and the draft, and hand over to the user.

### PRD checklist
1. Every section of the template has real content (`None` is fine only for Open questions and Dependencies).
2. Problem names a specific business role, what they cannot do today, and the business impact.
3. *Today* says what users can and cannot do now (business terms); Solution describes, in business language, what users will be able to do and see — enough for a BA to write stories.
4. At least 2 success criteria, each observable by a user or measurable in the business.
5. Out of scope is explicit and refers to the root CLAUDE.md out-of-scope list where it applies.
6. No technical design: no APIs, status codes, services or units, data model, classes or points (that is `/pl-arch`).
7. Dependencies are named, or explicitly "None".
8. Nothing from the root CLAUDE.md out-of-scope list appears in P1, P2 or P3.
9. Every backlog item has a size S / M / L, and P1 has no L.
10. No placeholders (`{…}`, TBD, TODO) left.

## Step 3 — Hand over
Show the PRD. Then ask before each of: publish it as a Confluence page `<title> — PRD` under the `Confluence parent
page`; create the epic in JIRA (Plumbline settings: JIRA project) with `epic.md` as its description (summary, PRD link
and version); its approval label as the JIRA hand-off says (`plumbline-prd-approved`). Show the exact content first and wait for a yes. After the epic exists,
put its key in the page title. No Confluence → the full PRD goes in the epic description.
