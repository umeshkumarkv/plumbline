description: Plumbline — after a change is merged, update the API spec and CLAUDE.md files to match it, checked by an independent judge
argument-hint: "<PR number, story key, or branch>"
---

# /pl-doc

After a change lands, bring the documentation in line with the code: the API spec (e.g. `openapi.yaml`) and the
CLAUDE.md files of the units it touched. A **writer** subagent edits the docs; an independent **judge** checks every
change in the code is reflected. Up to 3 attempts, then it is handed to the user. Docs only — never code.

Change: $ARGUMENTS

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-doc-writer` or `plumbline-judge` — in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`): wait for each result before the next step.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with
  agent `plumbline-doc-writer` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`). If subagents are not available, stop and say so.

Never do the writer's or the judge's work yourself. **Shell:** run only `git` (from the repository root — never `git -C`, which permission rules do not match), `bash .github/plumbline/check-template.sh` (and `gh` if present) yourself. Do not research the code yourself — that is the
writer's/runner's and the judge's job; you route, check scope and hand over.
If a helper replies with `FILE: <path>` and the content instead of writing the file, save that content to the path
unchanged, then continue — but only for a path you gave that helper; any other path is a FAIL finding, not a write.

## Every run
- **Judge replies:** only the judge's JSON counts. Not JSON → ask that judge once more, then count the attempt as FAIL
  ("judge reply unreadable"). Never decide PASS yourself or drop a finding before the next attempt.
- **Project memory:** helpers work from the CLAUDE.md files (kept current by `/pl-doc`) and the JIRA/Confluence
  material, opening code only for what they change or review; never research the code yourself. List their "Add to
  CLAUDE.md" / "CLAUDE.md out of date" notes in the hand-over for `/pl-doc`.
- **Freshness:** for each unit CLAUDE.md a helper gets, run `git log --oneline <its Last updated commit>..HEAD --
  <unit folder>`. Commits listed → tell the helpers and the judge "CLAUDE.md may be stale for: <files those commits
  changed>", and say so in the hand-over.
- **Templates and lanes:** everything that leaves this machine — JIRA, Confluence, PR descriptions and reviews — and
  every CLAUDE.md file is written on its template in `.github/plumbline/templates/` (`claude-root.md`,
  `claude-unit.md`, `claude-reference.md` for those files; the JIRA hand-off table for the rest), and names the
  template's version. Give each writer the template, the version (`.github/plumbline/VERSION`) and
  `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; tell the judge the writer's agent name, so it checks that agent's *Your lane*. Before
  each judge and before posting run `bash .github/plumbline/check-template.sh <template> <draft>` (it also fails text
  outside the lane): FAIL = that attempt's finding, no judge. No bash → the judge checks it. Set the footer's `judge`.
- **Limits:** at most 3 attempts per item, one writer and one judge each. More than 6 items → show the list and ask;
  nobody to answer → do the first 6 and list the rest.
- **Nobody to answer** (scheduled/headless): where a step says ask, take its safe choice or stop that item — never
  guess; write nothing outside the repository and `.plumbline-drafts/`; list the unasked questions in the hand-over.
- **Hand-over:** first line `PASS` · `FAIL after 3 attempts` · `STOPPED: <reason>` · `UNVERIFIED: <what did not
  run>`; then the details; then each question for the user with the exact text or command it would send or run.

## JIRA hand-off
Roles pass work to each other only through JIRA — tickets, comments and labels — never through files on someone's
machine, so no agent redoes what an earlier role settled. The PRD and each epic's HLD are Confluence pages (under the
`Confluence parent page` in the Plumbline settings), linked from the epic; every other hand-off is a ticket or comment.
The person running a command is that role's SME: their yes at the hand-over is the approval, and JIRA records who.

| Step | Posts | Template | Label added on the SME's yes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/pl-pm` | PRD page; the epic, with summary + PRD link | `prd.md`, `epic.md` | `plumbline-prd-approved` |
| `/pl-ba` | stories under the epic — business criteria | `story.md` | `plumbline-dor-ready` |
| `/pl-arch <EPIC>` | HLD page under the PRD; epic comment with its link; decisions → CLAUDE.md docs PR | `hld.md`, `handoff-hld.md`, `pr.md` | `plumbline-hld-final` |
| `/pl-arch <STORY>` | story comment — the LLD; story points set | `handoff-arch.md` | `plumbline-arch-approved` |
| `/pl-dev` | PR description; story comment — branch, PR, test result | `pr.md`, `handoff-dev.md` | — (the PR is reviewed next) |
| `/pl-code-review` | the same text as the PR review and the story comment | `handoff-review.md` | `plumbline-review-passed` |
| `/pl-qa` | story comment — evidence per criterion | `handoff-qa.md` | `plumbline-qa-passed` |
| `/pl-doc` | docs PR updating CLAUDE.md + story comment | `pr.md`, `handoff-doc.md` | the architect approves the docs PR |
| `/pl-devops` | PR description; story comment | `pr.md`, `handoff-devops.md` | — |
| `/pl-sm` | sprint report; one comment per flagged ticket | `sprint-report.md`, `sm-flag.md` | — |

- **Input:** read the ticket — description, labels, links, the latest comment of each kind that starts
  `[Plumbline /pl-<role>]` (JIRA returns `\[Plumbline …\]`: ignore backslashes), and each PRD or HLD page they link —
  **at the version named**; a story's HLD is linked from its epic (no version → compare last-modified times).
- **Gate:** start only when the previous step's label is on the ticket (a story's design also needs
  `plumbline-hld-final` on its epic). A hand-off edited after it was posted (comment `updated` later than `created`;
  PRD or HLD page past the pinned version) → `STOPPED: <what> changed after approval — re-run <command>`.
- **The architect's word is final:** later roles follow the HLD and LLD exactly. A role that cannot → `STOPPED:
  design gap — /pl-arch <KEY>`; never work around it. Do not redo an earlier role's work.
- **Output:** post what the table says, on its template, after the SME's yes with the exact text shown first; then
  add the label.
- No Confluence tools or no parent page → the PRD goes in the epic description, the HLD in the epic comment. A comment must stay under 30,000
  characters (JIRA's limit is 32,767): longer → split. No JIRA tools → output as text to paste. Drafts are scratch.

## Metrics
At the hand-over append to `.plumbline-drafts/metrics.csv` (header, if new:
`date,command,target,attempts,verdict,tests_run,minutes,human_decision`): date, command, story/branch/PR, attempts,
verdict, tests ran `yes`/`no`/`n/a`, minutes (`date +%s` at start and at hand-over), and `human_decision` once the user
answers: `approved`, `edited` or `rejected`. It stays local; `/pl-sm metrics` summarises it.
**Files:** create drafts and metrics with your write tool (it creates folders) — never `mkdir`, `echo`, `printf` or
redirection, which permission settings block.

## Step 1 — The change
1. Find the change: a story key → the PR in its `[Plumbline /pl-dev]` comment; a PR number (`gh pr view <n>` / `gh pr diff <n>`, or the connected GitHub tools), a story key
   (search PRs for it), or a branch. Work out the commit range: `<base>...<merge or head>`.
2. List what changed in the code: endpoints, request/response fields, error codes, events/topics, cache keys, env vars,
   migrations, new libraries, new units. From the story's JIRA ticket also take: the **durable** business rules its
   acceptance criteria add — constraints every later change must keep, not display details (→ Rules, tagged
   `[decided <KEY>]`), the *Decisions* in its latest `[Plumbline /pl-arch]` comment (→ Decisions & trade-offs), and every
   "Add to CLAUDE.md" / "CLAUDE.md out of date" note in its `[Plumbline …]` comments. CLAUDE.md is the single source
   of truth: after this merge it must say everything the next agent needs, so no one rediscovers it from the code.
3. `git status` must be clean. Create a docs branch: `git switch -c docs/<KEY or pr-n> <base branch>`.

**Stop and ask the user** if: the change adds a new unit or a new cross-unit event (the root CLAUDE.md needs a human
decision first); the merged code contradicts the existing API spec in a way that needs an architecture call; or a new
library arrived without the root CLAUDE.md allowing it.

## Step 2 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Writer** — start `plumbline-doc-writer` with: the commit range, the output of `git diff <range>` saved with your
   write tool as `.plumbline-drafts/doc-<KEY or pr-n>/change.diff`, the list from Step 1, the files it may edit (the
   API spec files, and the CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.reference.md files of the touched units; the root CLAUDE.md only if the architecture changed); on
   attempts 2–3 the judge's findings.
2. **Scope check** — `git status --porcelain`: only documentation files changed. Anything else → finding, next attempt.
3. **Judge** — start `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* "the code change `git diff <range>` and the doc change
   `git diff`", the files edited; *Checklist:* the **Doc checklist** below, verbatim. PASS → Step 3. FAIL → next attempt.

### Doc checklist
1. Every endpoint the code change added or changed is in the API spec with the right method, path, parameters,
   request and response schema, and error responses.
2. Every new or changed response field is in the spec's schema with the right type (money as string where the
   CLAUDE.md files say so, ids with their format, timestamps as date-time).
3. Every new error code is documented, and every documented status/error code is what the code really returns — trace
   each thrown exception to its handler (an unhandled exception is a 500, not a 400).
4. Every new event/topic, cache key and environment variable is in the touched unit's CLAUDE.md.
5. New libraries and migrations are noted in the unit's CLAUDE.md.
6. Edits are in place: existing sections updated, nothing unrelated rewritten or removed; plumbline markers kept.
7. The root CLAUDE.md changed only if the architecture changed (new unit, new cross-unit event, new pattern).
8. The API spec still parses (valid YAML/JSON) and every documented path exists in the code.
9. New Rules are durable constraints tagged `[decided <KEY>]`; no `[decided]` rule was removed; each core CLAUDE.md
   is at most 8 KB and each reference file at most 30 KB, with the core's Reference counts still right.

## Step 3 — Hand over
Show the doc diff summary, each file's size before → after, any *Proposed removals*, and the judge verdict. Ask before commit, push and opening a docs PR described on `pr.md`, and before the JIRA
comment `[Plumbline /pl-doc] <date>` with the docs PR link — show the exact text first and wait for a yes. The docs PR
needs the architect's approval: the architect owns what CLAUDE.md says. Set (keeping the template version) `Last updated: <merge commit> (<date>,
/pl-doc)` in each CLAUDE.md you change. Never commit to the base branch directly.
