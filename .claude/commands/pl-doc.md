description: Plumbline — after a change is merged, update the API spec and CLAUDE.md files to match it, checked by an independent judge
argument-hint: "<PR number, story key, or branch>"

# /pl-doc

After a change lands, bring the documentation in line with the code: the API spec (e.g. `openapi.yaml`) and the
CLAUDE.md files of the units it touched. A **writer** subagent edits the docs; an independent **judge** checks every
change in the code is reflected. Up to 3 attempts, then it is handed to the user. Docs only — never code.

Change: $ARGUMENTS

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-doc-writer` or `plumbline-judge`.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with
  agent `plumbline-doc-writer` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`). If subagents are not available, stop and say so.

Never do the writer's or the judge's work yourself. **Shell:** run only `git` (and `gh` if present) yourself. Do not research the code yourself — that is the
writer's/runner's and the judge's job; you route, check scope and hand over.

## Step 1 — The change
1. Find the change: a PR number (`gh pr view <n>` / `gh pr diff <n>`, or the connected GitHub tools), a story key
   (search PRs for it), or a branch. Work out the commit range: `<base>...<merge or head>`.
2. List what changed in the code: endpoints, request/response fields, error codes, events/topics, cache keys, env vars,
   migrations, new libraries, new units.
3. `git status` must be clean. Create a docs branch: `git switch -c docs/<KEY or pr-n> <base branch>`.

**Stop and ask the user** if: the change adds a new unit or a new cross-unit event (the root CLAUDE.md needs a human
decision first); the merged code contradicts the existing API spec in a way that needs an architecture call; or a new
library arrived without the root CLAUDE.md allowing it.

## Step 2 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Writer** — start `plumbline-doc-writer` with: the commit range, the list from Step 1, the files it may edit (the
   API spec files and CLAUDE.md files of the touched units; the root CLAUDE.md only if the architecture changed); on
   attempts 2–3 the judge's findings.
2. **Scope check** — `git status --porcelain`: only documentation files changed. Anything else → finding, next attempt.
3. **Judge** — start `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* "the code change `git diff <range>` and the doc change
   `git diff`", the files edited; *Checklist:* the **Doc checklist** below, verbatim. PASS → Step 3. FAIL → next attempt.

### Doc checklist
1. Every endpoint the code change added or changed is in the API spec with the right method, path, parameters,
   request and response schema, and error responses.
2. Every new or changed response field is in the spec's schema with the right type (money as string where the
   CLAUDE.md files say so, ids with their format, timestamps as date-time).
3. Every new error code is documented.
4. Every new event/topic, cache key and environment variable is in the touched unit's CLAUDE.md.
5. New libraries and migrations are noted in the unit's CLAUDE.md.
6. Edits are in place: existing sections updated, nothing unrelated rewritten or removed; plumbline markers kept.
7. The root CLAUDE.md changed only if the architecture changed (new unit, new cross-unit event, new pattern).
8. The API spec still parses (valid YAML/JSON) and every documented path exists in the code.

## Step 3 — Hand over
Show the doc diff summary and the judge verdict. Ask before commit, push and opening a docs PR — show the exact message
first and wait for a yes. Never commit to the base branch directly.
