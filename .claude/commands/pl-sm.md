description: Plumbline — daily sprint health report (stuck, blocked, unassigned, Definition of Done, velocity) from JIRA, checked by an independent judge
argument-hint: "[empty for the daily report, or a story key for one ticket]"
---

# /pl-sm

The daily sprint check: what is done, in review, in progress, blocked, at risk or unassigned; whether in-review
tickets meet the Definition of Done; velocity. A **writer** subagent writes the report from the sprint data; an
independent **judge** checks every list and number against that data. Up to 3 attempts, then it is handed to the
user. Comments are posted to JIRA only after the user says yes.

Target: $ARGUMENTS (empty = the whole active sprint; a key = that ticket only)

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-sm-writer` or `plumbline-judge` — in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`): wait for each result before the next step.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with
  agent `plumbline-sm-writer` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`). If subagents are not available, stop and say so.

Never do the writer's or the judge's work yourself. **Shell:** run only `git` (from the repository root — never `git -C`, which permission rules do not match) and `gh` yourself. Do not research the code yourself — that is the
writer's/runner's and the judge's job; you route, check scope and hand over.
If a helper replies with `FILE: <path>` and the content instead of writing the file, save that content to the path
unchanged, then continue — but only for a path you gave that helper; any other path is a FAIL finding, not a write.

## Every run
- **Judge replies:** the judge answers with the JSON its instructions give. If a reply is not that JSON, ask the same
  judge once to answer in that format; if it still does not, count the attempt as FAIL with the finding "judge reply
  unreadable". Never decide PASS yourself, and never edit or summarise away a finding before the next attempt.
- **Project memory:** the CLAUDE.md files are the single source of truth for the project, kept current after every
  merge by `/pl-doc`. Helpers work from them and from the JIRA ticket; they open code only for the files they change
  or review. Never research the code yourself. Collect what helpers report as "Add to CLAUDE.md" or "CLAUDE.md out
  of date" and list it in the hand-over for `/pl-doc`.
- **Templates:** whatever will be posted is written on its template in `.github/plumbline/templates/` (see the
  JIRA hand-off table). Before each judge, and again before posting, run
  `bash .github/plumbline/check-template.sh <template> <draft>`: a FAIL is that attempt's finding and the judge is not
  started. If bash cannot run here, add "matches its template's headings and fields" to the judge's checklist.
  Give each writer its template, the version (`.github/plumbline/VERSION`), `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `Run by`
  (the connected Atlassian user's name; else ask once).
- **Limits:** at most 3 attempts per item, one writer and one judge per attempt. If the work covers more than 6 items
  (stories, units, tickets), show the list and ask before starting; when nobody can answer, do the first 6 and list
  the rest in the hand-over.
- **Nobody to answer** (a scheduled or headless run): wherever a step says ask, take the safe choice it names, or else
  stop that item — never guess. Write nothing outside the repository and `.plumbline-drafts/`, and list every
  question you could not ask in the hand-over.
- **Hand-over:** the first line is one of `PASS` · `FAIL after 3 attempts` · `STOPPED: <reason>` · `UNVERIFIED: <what
  did not run>` — then the details, then each question for the user, each with the exact text or command it would
  send or run.

## JIRA hand-off
Roles pass work to each other only through JIRA and Confluence — never through files on someone's machine — so no
agent redoes what an earlier role settled. Specs people review and edit (PRD, design) are Confluence pages under the
`Confluence parent page` (Plumbline settings); JIRA holds the state (labels), a short summary and the page link.

| Step | Posts | Template | Approval label |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/pl-pm` | PRD page; the epic, with summary + PRD link | `prd.md`, `epic.md` | `plumbline-prd-approved` |
| `/pl-ba` | stories under the epic — criteria, points, `Blocks` links | `story.md` | `plumbline-dor-ready` |
| `/pl-arch` | design page under the PRD page; story comment with its link and version | `design.md`, `handoff-arch.md` | `plumbline-arch-approved` |
| `/pl-dev` | story comment — branch, PR, test result | `handoff-dev.md` | — (the PR is reviewed next) |
| `/pl-code-review` | PR review + story comment — verdict and findings | `handoff-review.md` | `plumbline-review-passed` |
| `/pl-qa` | story comment — evidence per criterion | `handoff-qa.md` | `plumbline-qa-passed` |
| `/pl-doc` | docs PR updating CLAUDE.md + story comment | `handoff-doc.md` | the architect approves the docs PR |
| `/pl-devops`, `/pl-sm` | comment on the story / sprint issue | `handoff-devops.md`, `sprint-report.md` | — |

- **Input:** read the ticket — description, labels, links, the latest comment of each kind that starts
  `[Plumbline /pl-<role>]`, and each page those link to, **at the version the comment names**. A page now at a later
  version → `STOPPED: <page> changed after approval (v<n> → v<m>)`. Do not redo an earlier role's work; if it is
  wrong, stop and say which role must fix it.
- **Gate:** start only when the previous step's label is on the ticket. With `Separate approver: yes` (Plumbline
  settings; the default) it must also have been added — per the issue's change history — by someone other than that
  step's `Run by`. Otherwise stop: `STOPPED: <label> not on <KEY>` · `STOPPED: <label> on <KEY> self-approved by
  <name>` · `STOPPED: cannot verify who approved <KEY>`. Only with `Separate approver: no` may the SME say go on.
- **Output:** post what the table says, on its template, after the SME's yes with the exact text shown first.
  `Run by` is the connected Atlassian user. `Separate approver: yes` → do not add the label: write `Approval: pending
  — <label> to be added by the <role> approver` and tell the SME who must approve. `no` → add the label after the yes
  and write `Approval: self — <name> (<date>)`.
- No Confluence tools or no parent page → the PRD goes in the epic description and the design in the arch comment.
  No JIRA tools → give the output as text to paste, and say the hand-off is manual. `.plumbline-drafts/` is scratch.

## Metrics
At the hand-over, append one line to `.plumbline-drafts/metrics.csv` (create it with the header
`date,command,target,attempts,verdict,tests_run,minutes,human_decision` if missing): today's date, this command, the
story/branch/PR, attempts used, the final verdict, `yes`/`no`/`n/a` for whether the build/tests ran, the
minutes from start to hand-over (run `date +%s` once at the start and once at the hand-over), and leave
`human_decision` empty. When the user answers the hand-over question, fill it in: `approved`, `edited`, or `rejected`.
The file stays on this machine (`.plumbline-drafts/.gitignore` holds `*`); `/pl-sm` can summarise it.
**Files:** create every draft and metrics file with your write tool — it creates missing folders. Never
`mkdir`, `echo`, `printf` or redirection: permission settings block them.

## Metrics mode
**`/pl-sm metrics`** — instead of the sprint report, read `.plumbline-drafts/metrics.csv` and show one table per
command: runs, median attempts, median minutes, PASS rate, runs where tests did not run, and approved / edited /
rejected / not yet answered (rows written before 2.6 have no minutes). Numbers only from the file; no judge needed. Stop after the table.

## Step 1 — Sprint data
With the connected JIRA/Atlassian tools, fetch the data as below. Without them, ask the user for an export of the
sprint's issues (JIRA "Export → CSV" or JSON, plus last sprint's Done count) and use that as the source instead.
1. JIRA project from the root `CLAUDE.md` Plumbline settings. Fetch the active sprint's issues (JQL
   `project = <KEY> AND sprint in openSprints()`): key, summary, status, assignee, updated, story points, labels,
   blocked-by links, whether the description has acceptance criteria. Also the previous sprint's Done count.
2. For each In Review ticket, its PR state: human approval, `/pl-code-review` result, CI status, merged
   (`gh pr list --search <KEY>` or the connected GitHub tools).
3. Write all of it, **unedited**, with today's date, to `.plumbline-drafts/sprint-<name>/facts.md` — make sure `.plumbline-drafts/.gitignore` exists with the single line `*` (write it with your write tool; it
   keeps the folder out of git without touching `.git/`). This file is the single source of truth.

**Stop and ask the user** if: JIRA returns an error; more than one sprint is open; a blocked-by chain is circular.

## Step 2 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Writer** — start `plumbline-sm-writer` with: the facts path, the report path
   `.plumbline-drafts/sprint-<name>/standup.md`; on attempts 2–3 the judge's findings.
2. **Judge** — start `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* the standup path and the facts path; *Checklist:* the
   **Sprint report checklist** below, verbatim. PASS → Step 3. FAIL → next attempt.

### Sprint report checklist
1. Sections present: Done, In review, In progress, Blocked, At risk, Unassigned, Velocity, Flags for action, Comments.
2. Each list contains exactly the tickets the facts imply — recompute from the facts file: at risk = In Progress with
   no update for more than 2 days; needs attention = In Review for more than 1 day; blocked = a blocker that is not
   Done; unassigned = To Do with no assignee; no acceptance criteria flagged.
3. Velocity numbers equal the facts (this sprint's Done count and points, last sprint's count, trend).
4. Definition of Done is checked for every In Review ticket: acceptance criteria tested (QA passed), PR approved by a
   human, code review passed on the current commit, CI green, merged — each item marked from the facts.
5. Every flagged ticket says why and who must act; risks are ordered by impact on the sprint goal.
6. Comments to post are factual — no blame, no guesses presented as facts — and nothing contradicts the facts file.

## Step 3 — Hand over
Show the report. Ask before posting: the report (e.g. as a comment on the sprint's tracking issue or a Confluence
page) and the per-ticket comments — show the exact text first and wait for a yes. Never move or close a ticket whose
Definition of Done is not met.
