# /pl-dev

Implement one story on a new branch. A **writer** subagent makes the change; then three checks: the project's
**build/tests**, a **scope check** (only allowed files changed), and an independent **judge**. Up to 3 attempts, then
it is handed to the user. Nothing is committed, pushed or posted without the user's yes.

Story: $ARGUMENTS

## How subagents are started
- **Claude Code:** the Agent tool with `subagent_type: plumbline-dev-writer` or `plumbline-judge` — in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`): wait for each result before the next step.
- **GitHub Copilot:** VS Code — `#runSubagent` (the `agent/runSubagent` tool); Copilot CLI — the `task` tool; with agent `plumbline-dev-writer` or `plumbline-judge` (`.github/agents/`).
  If subagents are not available in this chat, stop and say so.

Never do the writer's or the judge's work yourself, and never pass the writer's reasoning to the judge. **Shell:** run
only `git` (from the repository root — never `git -C`, which permission rules do not match) and the project's build/test command yourself (they work in bash, PowerShell and cmd alike); find and read
files with your file search/read tools — never `find`, `grep`, `ls`, `cat`.
If a helper replies with `FILE: <path>` and the content instead of writing the file, save that content to the path
unchanged, then continue — but only for a path you gave that helper; any other path is a FAIL finding, not a write.

## Every run
- **Judge replies:** only the judge's JSON counts. Not JSON → ask that judge once more, then count the attempt as FAIL
  ("judge reply unreadable"). Never decide PASS yourself or drop a finding before the next attempt.
- **Project memory:** no root `CLAUDE.md` → `STOPPED: run /pl-onboard first` (only `/pl-onboard` runs without one).
  Helpers work from the CLAUDE.md files (kept current by `/pl-doc`) and the JIRA/Confluence
  material, opening code only for what they change or review; never research the code yourself. List their "Add to
  CLAUDE.md" / "CLAUDE.md out of date" notes in the hand-over for `/pl-doc`.
- **Templates and lanes:** everything that leaves this machine — JIRA, Confluence, PR descriptions and reviews — and
  every CLAUDE.md file is written on its template in `.github/plumbline/templates/` (`claude-root.md`,
  `claude-unit.md`, `claude-reference.md` for those files; the JIRA hand-off table for the rest), and names the
  template's version. Give each writer the template, the version (`.github/plumbline/VERSION.md`) and the
  commit (`/pl-dev`, `/pl-code-review`: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; every other command: `—`); tell the judge the writer's agent name, so it checks that agent's *Your lane*. Before
  each judge and before posting, do the **Template check** in `.github/plumbline/templates/README.md` yourself (it
  also catches text outside the lane): any miss is that attempt's finding, no judge. Fill the footer's `judge`, minutes and
  `SME edited`.
- **Limits:** at most 3 attempts per item, one writer and one judge each. More than 6 items → show the list and ask;
  nobody to answer → do the first 6 and list the rest.
- **Nobody to answer** (scheduled/headless): where a step says ask, take its safe choice or stop that item — never
  guess; write nothing outside the repository and `.plumbline-drafts/`; list the unasked questions in the hand-over.
- **Hand-over:** first line `PASS` · `FAIL after 3 attempts` · `STOPPED: <reason>` · `UNVERIFIED: <what did not
  run>`; then the details; then each question for the user with the exact text or command it would send or run.

## JIRA hand-off
Roles pass work to each other only through JIRA, Confluence and the PR (or MR) — never through files on someone's
machine; every person works in their own clone (OPERATING-MODEL.md). The PRD and each epic's HLD are Confluence pages
under the `Confluence parent page` (Plumbline settings), linked from the epic; every other hand-off is a ticket, a
comment, or a PR comment. Only `/pl-dev` and `/pl-code-review` use git.

| Step | Posts | Template | Label added on the SME's yes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/pl-pm` | PRD page; the epic, with summary + PRD link | `prd.md`, `epic.md` | `plumbline-prd-approved` |
| `/pl-ba` | stories under the epic — business criteria | `story.md` | `plumbline-dor-ready` |
| `/pl-arch <EPIC>` | HLD page under the PRD; epic comment with its link and the CLAUDE.md text for dev | `hld.md`, `handoff-hld.md` | `plumbline-hld-final` |
| `/pl-arch <STORY>` | story comment — the LLD; story points set | `handoff-arch.md` | `plumbline-arch-approved` |
| `/pl-dev` | branch + PR; story comment; later applies doc's text to the PR | `pr.md`, `handoff-dev.md` | — |
| `/pl-doc` | the same text as a PR comment and a story comment — exact docs text per file | `handoff-doc.md` | `plumbline-docs-ready` |
| `/pl-code-review` | the same text as the PR review and a story comment — code and docs | `handoff-review.md` | `plumbline-review-passed` |
| merge | a person merges (branch protection; the architect approves CLAUDE.md files) | — | — |
| `/pl-devops` | after merge: story comment — pipeline, deployed commit, QA URL; on a PR's CI failure: the fix | `handoff-deploy.md`, `handoff-devops.md` | `plumbline-deployed-qa` |
| `/pl-qa` | story comment — evidence per criterion | `handoff-qa.md` | `plumbline-qa-passed` |
| `/pl-sm` | sprint report; one comment per flagged ticket; team metrics | `sprint-report.md`, `sm-flag.md` | — |

- **Input:** the ticket (description, labels, links), the latest `[Plumbline /pl-<role>]` comment of each kind (JIRA
  shows `\[Plumbline …\]`: ignore backslashes), and each PRD or HLD page they link at the version named.
- **Gate:** start only when the previous step's label is on the ticket (a story's LLD also needs `plumbline-hld-final`
  on its epic; doc needs the dev comment; QA needs `plumbline-deployed-qa`). A hand-off edited after it was posted
  (comment `updated` later than `created`; a page past its pinned version) → `STOPPED: <what> changed after approval`.
- **The architect's word is final:** later roles follow the HLD and LLD exactly. A role that cannot → `STOPPED:
  design gap — /pl-arch <KEY>`; never work around it. Do not redo an earlier role's work.
- **Output:** show the exact text, then ask: *"Your yes approves this as the <role> SME. JIRA will show you as the
  person who posted it."* On yes: post, add the label.
- **Status:** with that yes, move the ticket via JIRA's transitions to the `Workflow` statuses: `/pl-dev` → In Progress
  (epic too), then In Review with the PR; a review or QA FAIL → In Progress; `/pl-qa` PASS → Done (epic with its last
  story). Never force one. Review changes to the API or rules → run `/pl-doc` again on the same PR.
- No Confluence → the PRD goes in the epic description, the HLD in the epic comment. A comment stays under 30,000
  characters (JIRA's limit 32,767): longer → split. No JIRA tools → output as text to paste. Drafts are scratch.

## Metrics
Metrics live in JIRA, in the footer of every hand-off: judge result and attempts, minutes from start to hand-over
(`date +%s` at both — the one non-build command every command may run), and `SME edited: yes` if the SME changed the
text before posting. `/pl-sm metrics` reads them from JIRA, so the whole team sees the same numbers.
**Files:** before the first draft, create `.plumbline-drafts/.gitignore` containing `*` (drafts are your private
scratch, never committed). Create drafts with your write tool — never `mkdir`, `echo`, `printf` or redirection.

## Step 1 — The story
- Several keys (`CRS-301 CRS-302`): implement them in that order on one branch; everything below applies to each.
- A JIRA key: read the story (summary, description, acceptance criteria), and its latest `[Plumbline /pl-arch]` comment (the design) with the connected JIRA/Atlassian tools, and save both in `.plumbline-drafts/<KEY>/` for this run's
  writer and judge. No `plumbline-arch-approved` label → `STOPPED` (see JIRA hand-off). No JIRA tools → ask the user to
  paste the story and the design.
- A description: use it. No acceptance criteria at all → stop and ask; never invent them.
- **Apply mode** — the story has `plumbline-docs-ready` and its PR is open: switch to the PR branch, apply the latest
  `[Plumbline /pl-doc]` *Text to apply* **word for word** (and, on the epic's first story, the HLD comment's *CLAUDE.md
  changes*), check each file now contains exactly that text, commit `<KEY>: docs from /pl-doc`, push, and hand over:
  next `/pl-code-review`. No writer, no judge, nothing else changed. Text that no longer fits the code → `STOPPED: re-run
  /pl-doc <KEY>`.

## Step 2 — Prepare
1. Read the root `CLAUDE.md` (base branch) and the CLAUDE.md files of the units the story touches.
2. Build/test command: from the units' CLAUDE.md "Build & run" (on Windows use the `.cmd` wrapper, e.g. `mvnw.cmd`).
3. `git status` clean, then `git switch -c <branch> <base branch>`, named by the *Branch pattern* setting.
4. **Baseline:** run the build/test command once first; failures now are pre-existing — note which. Cannot run at all →
   tell the user and continue: tests are still written, and the judge checks them by reading.

## Step 3 — Attempts (1, 2, 3)
1. **Writer** — start `plumbline-dev-writer` with: the story, the design path(s), the branch, the units and their
   CLAUDE.md paths, the build/test command; on attempts 2–3 also the previous findings and build output.
2. **Build/tests** — run the build/test command yourself. A failure that is not in the baseline → that is the finding;
   next attempt. Pre-existing failures do not count; say so in the hand-over.
3. **Scope check** — run `git diff --name-only <base branch>` and `git status --porcelain`. Fail if anything under
   `.claude/`, `.github/`, any `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, or CI/build settings that skip tests changed, or if an
   existing test was deleted. → next attempt with that as the finding.
4. **Judge** — `plumbline-judge` with exactly: *Review:* "the change on this branch: `git diff <base branch>`", the
   story, the design path(s), the CLAUDE.md paths; *Checklist:* the **Dev checklist**, verbatim. FAIL → next attempt.

After 3 failed attempts: stop, show the last findings and the branch, and hand over to the user.

### Dev checklist
1. Each acceptance criterion is implemented, and has a test that would fail without the change (name the test).
2. The change follows the rules and Must-never items in the root and unit CLAUDE.md files.
3. No test was deleted, skipped or weakened to pass; no check was switched off.
4. Inputs are validated; no secrets in code or logs; no SQL/command built by string concatenation; errors do not
   leak internals.
5. Only the code the story needs changed; nothing unrelated.
6. Any API or schema change is backward compatible, or the story says it may break — and callers in other units are
   updated or listed.
7. Every test the design's Tests section lists exists in the diff — answer as a list `design item → test name`. A
   missing one fails this item, unless the story itself moves it to another named story.
8. The change follows the LLD and HLD exactly (endpoints, order of checks, error codes, files, units, data
   ownership). Any difference fails this item — the fix is the design (`/pl-arch`), never a deviation.

## Step 4 — Hand over
Tests could not run (or only for some units) → the hand-over's first line is **UNVERIFIED — tests written, not run
(<reason>). Run `<command>` before merging.** Never call it "tested".
Show the AC → tests and design → tests tables, files changed, build result and judge verdict. Then ask before each of:
commit (`<KEY>: <summary>`), push, open the PR described on `pr.md`, and the `[Plumbline /pl-dev]` comment on
`handoff-dev.md` — exact text first, then a yes. Next: `/pl-doc <KEY>`.
